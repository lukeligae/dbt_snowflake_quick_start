/*
	This macro generates the SQL for a given model with all references pulled up into import CTEs, which you can then paste back into the model.
	
	Arguments:	
		â€¢ model_names (required): The model(s) you wish to generate YAML for.	  
 */

-- A. First, Create a model with your original SQL query. 
/*
 Examples 1: Creat a file original_query1.sql and svae it in any subfolder of /models
      original_query1.sql:    select * from raw.jaffle_shop.customers
 */
-- B. Compile the code below in Cloud IDE 
--
	{{ codegen.generate_model_import_ctes( model_name = 'orignal_query1') }}

/*
It will genertae the new model with cte below: 

with raw_jaffle_shop_customers as (
    select * from raw.jaffle_shop.customers
    -- CAUTION: It's best practice to use the ref or source function instead of a direct reference
)
select * from raw_jaffle_shop_customers

 */

 Examples 2: Creat a file original_query2.sql and svae it in any subfolder of /models

/*
Or Alternative, run the command below:

$ dbt run-operation generate_model_import_ctes --args '{"model_name": "my_dbt_model"}'

It will genrate the new ctes sql for the model. 
Copy/paste the cte sql, and refactor as required to update the orignal sql query
